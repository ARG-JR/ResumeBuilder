# Sign Out Route

This route is not a page, but a view.

Rather than rendering a template, it will run the code to sign the logged in user out and redirect them to the [sign in](SIGN_IN.md) page.

If the user isn't logged in, it will just redirect them to the [sign in](SIGN_IN.md) page without attempting to sign them out.
